I just wanted to see what would happen .
brea@@ the , d@@ am@@ n you !

she used mar@@ gar@@ ine inst@@ ead of bu@@ t@@ ter .
I &apos;ll dri@@ ve you some@@ where .
Tom is ob@@ st@@ in@@ ate .
we have to learn all the s@@ on@@ gs before the end of the week .
would you like to vis@@ it the c@@ ity ?
this gu@@ y &apos;s great at p@@ it@@ ching cu@@ r@@ ve@@ b@@ all@@ s .
one wee@@ k@@ end all of the ho@@ tel@@ s in the c@@ ity were fu@@ ll because there was a lar@@ ge con@@ ven@@ tion .
I didn &apos;t see Tom yesterday .
we still have a few wee@@ ks left .
she got all f@@ lu@@ st@@ er@@ ed when the boy she likes came over to talk to her .
there &apos;s less of it , but no less to it .
that h@@ at be@@ com@@ es you .
how long does it take to wal@@ k from here to the c@@ ity h@@ all ?
he dre@@ am@@ ed about his home .
they have a ten @-@ year @-@ old son .

I &apos;ll be home by mi@@ d@@ night at the l@@ at@@ est .
I don &apos;t think they al@@ low that .
come again ?
I saw the c@@ ake you made .
Tom and Mary have dec@@ i@@ ded to get married in O@@ c@@ to@@ ber .
where are your friends going ?
as the door s@@ li@@ d open , he al@@ most f@@ ell on@@ to the pl@@ at@@ for@@ m .
can you use a com@@ pu@@ ter ?
that &apos;s a lot of cas@@ h .
he &apos;s not a bad person .
if I tell him the truth , she will never for@@ give me .
you should have seen her .
some day we &apos;ll take a tri@@ p to In@@ di@@ a .
what time do you want me to pic@@ k you up ?
you got what you wanted , didn &apos;t you ?
I can &apos;t wal@@ k anymore .
I@@ r@@ an is not I@@ ra@@ q .
his de@@ b@@ ts am@@ oun@@ t to two mil@@ li@@ on doll@@ ars .
Tom &apos;s eyes were fu@@ ll of t@@ ears .
what is today &apos;s d@@ ate ?
I &apos;ve mis@@ sed you so much , Tom .
should I tell him that I like him or that I love him ?
I have nothing to f@@ ear .
I just in@@ v@@ ent@@ ed a new word @-@ pro@@ c@@ es@@ so@@ r en@@ ab@@ ling to pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce them b@@ ac@@ k@@ war@@ ds .
the old man started to l@@ au@@ gh s@@ ad@@ ly .
I &apos;m ap@@ pl@@ ying for a job .
who will correc@@ t my mist@@ a@@ kes ?
do you think it was easy for me ?
I s@@ cre@@ am@@ ed but nobody could hear me .
can anyone dri@@ ve ?
I am very ill at ea@@ se with str@@ ang@@ ers .
do you want me to tell Tom that we won &apos;t do that ?
two wee@@ ks have pass@@ ed and I haven &apos;t seen you .
don &apos;t look !
why don &apos;t you love me ?
Tom wants to buy a b@@ ass gu@@ it@@ ar , but he doesn &apos;t have enough money .
I know you see it , but are you really looking at it ?
I cannot put up with her be@@ h@@ av@@ i@@ or .
any of you can do it .
I remember what I saw .
they ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that they &apos;d li@@ ed .
I don &apos;t like sw@@ im@@ ming in po@@ o@@ ls .
can you understand the me@@ an@@ ing of this senten@@ ce ?
the man was hi@@ ding in a den@@ se for@@ est .
I know that this is we@@ ir@@ d .
that would make sen@@ se .
no one had seen anything .
I have no si@@ bl@@ ings .
what &apos;s the go@@ l@@ d@@ en ru@@ le ?
he can har@@ d@@ ly speak any English .
I had my watch m@@ end@@ ed .
we can help you .
are you in@@ vol@@ ved in poli@@ ti@@ c@@ s ?
b@@ low out the c@@ and@@ les .
I wasn &apos;t enti@@ r@@ ely sure myself .
you don &apos;t have to lie .
it was a beautiful night .
I think you made the right cho@@ ice .
the truth is I told a lie .
Tom has the ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence n@@ ec@@ ess@@ ary .
how do you stop this ?
you have too many ir@@ ons in the fi@@ re .
but it &apos;s me who should th@@ ank you .
he came while I was still as@@ le@@ ep .
I took over the bus@@ in@@ ess from F@@ a@@ ther .
o@@ il is ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve .
where did Tom buy it ?
I bought a house .
do you know who we are ?
it &apos;s as old as the world .
Dan an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced that he and L@@ in@@ da were getting di@@ v@@ or@@ ced .
I have a vis@@ a .
it will be a great plea@@ sure for me to trans@@ late the story and to read it to you .
what &apos;s with the lu@@ gg@@ age ?
something is asked of me .
it &apos;s like being a k@@ id in a c@@ and@@ y sto@@ re .
M@@ ath@@ s is a good sub@@ j@@ ect .
you really speak French well .
for exam@@ ple , more people are cho@@ o@@ sing to live together and have children without getting married .
are you ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ly thin@@ king about going ?
it was a plea@@ sure meeting you , Tom .
if you don &apos;t eat , you &apos;ll di@@ e .
I don &apos;t know why Tom doesn &apos;t like Boston .
I don &apos;t have the right e@@ qui@@ p@@ ment .
I r@@ an out@@ side and the door lo@@ c@@ ked it@@ self be@@ h@@ ind me .
it would be coun@@ ter @-@ produ@@ c@@ tive to do such a thing .
what do you want ?
I &apos;m waiting im@@ pati@@ ent@@ ly .
S@@ p@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ a was a pan@@ the@@ ist .
I like bo@@ th sci@@ ence and mat@@ h .
we &apos;re not cert@@ ain of that yet .
I know it &apos;s not im@@ possible .
I work in the morning .
Tom has re@@ qu@@ es@@ ted my as@@ sist@@ ance .
do you want to get us bo@@ th k@@ illed ?
they all speak French .
why are you so good at ex@@ pl@@ ain@@ ing things ?
no one will stop me .
I &apos;m a tr@@ ai@@ ne@@ e .
how much are you being p@@ aid to do this ?
she was lo@@ ved by everybody in the v@@ illage .
where do you train your stu@@ dents ?
have you seen my cam@@ era ?
I hear you were gr@@ oun@@ ded .
this book is too lar@@ ge to go in my po@@ ck@@ et .
could you please o@@ ver@@ look it this time ?
when I was your age , I had a bo@@ y@@ friend .
I hate that gu@@ y .
I &apos;m pre@@ tty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t have a brother .
he bor@@ ro@@ w@@ ed the car from his friend .
this T@@ V was made in Ch@@ in@@ a .
I feel sick every morning .
you should know yourself .
he took this photo .
would you like to read this mag@@ az@@ ine ?
he took char@@ ge of the fir@@ m after his father &apos;s de@@ ath .
Tom and I u@@ su@@ ally tal@@ ked to each other in French .
I f@@ illed up the v@@ ase with water .
it doesn &apos;t matter who s@@ ays that , it &apos;s not true .
this is how I made it .
do you know how to play ch@@ ess ?
this bicy@@ cle is mine . y@@ ours is over there .
it &apos;s an em@@ er@@ gen@@ c@@ y !
for me , the re@@ al world is just a f@@ ic@@ tion .
spea@@ king of fil@@ ms , why not go to the cin@@ em@@ a ton@@ ight ?
Tom fel@@ t his phone vi@@ br@@ ate .
will it be f@@ ine tomorrow ?
I never really gave it much thought .
Tom likes liv@@ ing in Boston .
anything you want , my d@@ ear .
she at@@ tr@@ ac@@ ted me at first si@@ ght .
that is the f@@ un@@ ni@@ est jo@@ ke that I have ever heard .
he prom@@ is@@ ed to pro@@ vi@@ de information .
I &apos;m ta@@ king care of it . you can rel@@ a@@ x . you can r@@ ely on me .
are you still sick ?
I &apos;ve just spo@@ ken to your French teacher and he s@@ ays you &apos;re doing well in his cl@@ ass .
everybody &apos;s in a hur@@ ry these days .
she likes to go to the li@@ br@@ ary .
everyone is waiting in the other room .
it mat@@ ters to me .
the cold air re@@ viv@@ ed Tom .
are you out of your mind ?
she tem@@ p@@ ted him .
everyone can make a differ@@ ence in their own lives and th@@ er@@ e@@ by coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ ely make the world a better place for th@@ em@@ sel@@ ves and oth@@ ers around them .
you &apos;re not in a hur@@ ry , are you ?
let &apos;s come back to it l@@ ater .
I should talk to Tom .
you &apos;d better stay with me .
once u@@ po@@ n a time there liv@@ ed an em@@ per@@ or who was a great con@@ qu@@ er@@ or , and re@@ ig@@ ned over more coun@@ tri@@ es than anyone in the world .
can you come to the party ?
don &apos;t s@@ pl@@ as@@ h me !
Tom har@@ d@@ ly spo@@ ke any French when I first met him .
I don &apos;t have enough money for my tri@@ p .
there &apos;s only one pre@@ tty child in the world , and every mother has it .
J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es made it cl@@ ear that he wanted to meet M@@ r G@@ ag@@ n@@ on .
everyone is free to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te .
Tom was mu@@ gg@@ ed on his way home from work .
they made sure nobody could see them .
a gu@@ y ne@@ ar@@ ly r@@ an into us .
I think we have some un@@ finished bus@@ in@@ ess .
I &apos;ve lost my f@@ ill@@ ing .
do you think that &apos;s true ?
if you would be a good read@@ er , read ; if a wri@@ ter , write .
I hate those sp@@ i@@ der@@ s . they &apos;re always there to f@@ re@@ a@@ k me out when I &apos;m c@@ le@@ an@@ ing .
no such person ex@@ i@@ sts .
do your best !
I gave up hope .
she ad@@ vis@@ ed him to cut down on smo@@ king .
no matter how much I think about it , I can &apos;t understand it .
she told him a jo@@ ke .
can you put the children to bed ?
Mar@@ ie &apos;s hi@@ ding something from me .
did you go to Tom &apos;s party last S@@ at@@ ur@@ day ?
he w@@ ro@@ te a no@@ v@@ el b@@ as@@ ed on an@@ ci@@ ent m@@ y@@ th@@ s .
Tom went ro@@ ck c@@ li@@ m@@ b@@ ing .
she didn &apos;t like this g@@ ame .
they &apos;ve kno@@ wn each other for a very long time .
don &apos;t tou@@ ch this !
you &apos;ve been war@@ ned .
he pl@@ ays the piano very well .
what makes you so sure Tom was the one who sto@@ le your bicy@@ cle ?
she has good i@@ de@@ as .
what a hor@@ ri@@ ble thing !
we have no cho@@ ice but to give up the wh@@ ole plan .
you &apos;re a tr@@ ai@@ tor .
we take ris@@ ks all the time .
Z@@ ai@@ l@@ ai@@ b@@ a b@@ ar is hi@@ r@@ ing wai@@ ters ; are you interes@@ ted ?
I can &apos;t li@@ ft my right ar@@ m .
I tried fl@@ ying from the to@@ p of the t@@ ree .
this pri@@ est is a good man .
I some@@ times lie on the gr@@ ass .
Tom thought Mary was s@@ af@@ e .
I just want to know why you br@@ ought me here .
open the door .
it &apos;s al@@ most hard to believe all these beautiful things were made by hand such a long time ag@@ o .
we as@@ su@@ me that he is hon@@ est .
are you all right ?
wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever ro@@ ad you may take , it will l@@ ead to the station .
if I were you , I &apos;d buy that one .
he makes himself acc@@ es@@ sible to all who see@@ k his coun@@ se@@ l .
I &apos;m sorry I mi@@ su@@ n@@ der@@ sto@@ od you .
where can I find a ta@@ x@@ i ?
she &apos;s going th@@ rough a mi@@ d@@ life cri@@ s@@ is .
the res@@ cu@@ ed re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es were lon@@ g@@ ing for f@@ re@@ e@@ d@@ om .
stop su@@ c@@ king up to the teacher .
re@@ pe@@ at@@ e@@ d@@ ly s@@ l@@ am@@ ming the c@@ lu@@ t@@ ch pe@@ d@@ al , I some@@ how man@@ ag@@ ed to get the c@@ lu@@ t@@ ch dis@@ en@@ g@@ ag@@ ed so I could just about dri@@ ve for the time being .
they did not believe me .
we know you &apos;re interes@@ ted .
the house is bu@@ r@@ ning !
we consi@@ der Tom hon@@ est .
I &apos;ll give you a sim@@ ple exam@@ ple .
win@@ ds from the se@@ a are mo@@ ist .
we have arriv@@ ed s@@ af@@ e and s@@ ound .
we are going to leave tomorrow .
M@@ r W@@ il@@ son is pr@@ ou@@ d of his house .
are you sure you don &apos;t want one ?
the meeting will be hel@@ d re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the wea@@ ther .
in the A@@ r@@ c@@ ti@@ c there are no pen@@ gu@@ ins .
she &apos;s young , n@@ ai@@ ve and in@@ ex@@ per@@ i@@ enc@@ ed .
