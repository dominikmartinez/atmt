the de@@ er was r@@ un@@ ning by it@@ self .
for him , di@@ v@@ or@@ ce is a good in@@ ven@@ tion , with one so@@ le dis@@ ad@@ v@@ ant@@ age : you have to get married first .
the bi@@ parti@@ s@@ an comm@@ is@@ sion &apos;s re@@ comm@@ end@@ ations were igno@@ red .

the fu@@ ture is no lon@@ ger what it used to be .
a father sh@@ ouldn &apos;t shi@@ r@@ k his respon@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ti@@ es to his children .
