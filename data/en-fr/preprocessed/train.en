there are 1@@ 0 ty@@ p@@ es of people in the world : those who understand b@@ in@@ ary , and those who don &apos;t .
I was hi@@ d@@ d@@ en .
we al@@ most f@@ ro@@ ze to de@@ ath .
I never fel@@ t com@@ for@@ table around your parents .
there was b@@ lo@@ od on Tom &apos;s shi@@ r@@ t .
he is a po@@ et of a sor@@ t .

Tom and Mary were in love with each other .
S@@ and@@ r@@ a has gro@@ wn up to be a beautiful woman .
I &apos;d su@@ gg@@ est that you c@@ le@@ an up a bit before your mother g@@ ets here .
here &apos;s where the fun beg@@ ins .
could you ad@@ d me ?
I sup@@ pose we have nothing to lo@@ se .
I wanted you to see that I &apos;m not all that bad .
I &apos;m afraid that Tom is in@@ vol@@ ved in a cri@@ me .
if your answ@@ er is correc@@ t , it fol@@ lo@@ ws that mine is wrong .
Tom and Mary had their hon@@ ey@@ mo@@ on in a fo@@ re@@ ig@@ n l@@ and .
we tried to che@@ er her up .
they bu@@ r@@ ned all the do@@ cu@@ m@@ ents .
you &apos;re the same age as my gir@@ l@@ friend .
I have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
no one believ@@ ed you .
the h@@ all was dec@@ or@@ ated with Jap@@ an@@ ese pain@@ t@@ ings .
if I were in your place , I would l@@ end him a hand .
nobody su@@ sp@@ ected anything .
I don &apos;t have much money now .
she made me hur@@ ry .
they ir@@ on@@ ed out their differ@@ ences .
these aren &apos;t my k@@ ey@@ s .
we are having lun@@ ch .

how is your d@@ augh@@ ter ?
it &apos;s lun@@ ch time .
see what hap@@ pen@@ s when you give people ad@@ vice ?
it &apos;s time for us to get ready .
if he doesn &apos;t come , we won &apos;t go .
what &apos;s wrong with you ton@@ ight ?
I can &apos;t believe that you aren &apos;t at le@@ ast w@@ ill@@ ing to consi@@ der the pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty of other al@@ tern@@ ati@@ ves .
you don &apos;t have to come .
I can fin@@ ally see the light at the end of the t@@ un@@ ne@@ l .
I was compl@@ et@@ ely dev@@ as@@ t@@ ated .
he turned his th@@ ou@@ gh@@ ts to@@ ward home .
you don &apos;t need to come so early .
I asked Tom if he nee@@ ded more money .
Tom knows that he can w@@ in .
I am very tired from the hard work .
I &apos;ve already told everybody to go home .
Tom never re@@ ach@@ ed Austr@@ ali@@ a .
we should have set off ear@@ li@@ er .
I me@@ an to go tomorrow if the wea@@ ther is f@@ ine .
may com@@ es after A@@ pri@@ l .
his de@@ ath was a great lo@@ ss to our fir@@ m .
my ol@@ der brother is an au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty on ph@@ il@@ o@@ so@@ ph@@ y .
everybody nee@@ ds to cal@@ m down .
there &apos;s a great restaurant around the cor@@ ner .
children f@@ illed the room .
why w@@ ouldn &apos;t you let me tell you what happened ?
it &apos;s r@@ ain@@ ing c@@ ats and do@@ gs .

I think so .
you look ner@@ vous .
I like being alone .
I have a few easy questions for you .

do you think this j@@ el@@ ly &apos;s fir@@ m enough to eat yet ?
I was on a tri@@ p to In@@ di@@ a .

Tom doesn &apos;t know the differ@@ ence bet@@ we@@ en a vir@@ us and a b@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ a .
what do you want to talk to me about ?
the boy was se@@ ar@@ ching for the lost k@@ ey .
su@@ g@@ ar dis@@ sol@@ ves in water .

do you have a table on the pati@@ o ?
you &apos;ll find this l@@ es@@ son easy .
believe me . I &apos;ll be a new man .
if only I could already speak Ger@@ man f@@ lu@@ ent@@ ly !
I want you to have a job that you love .
are Tom and Mary sure ?
I still don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re talking about .
Tom was like a brother to me .
I don &apos;t want to play with you any more .
be on your gu@@ ard ag@@ ain@@ st pic@@ k@@ po@@ ck@@ ets .
the girls are exc@@ ited .
what time &apos;s your train ?
he sp@@ un her around , took her in his ar@@ ms , di@@ p@@ ped her back , and gave her a big H@@ o@@ ll@@ y@@ w@@ o@@ od k@@ is@@ s .
Tom is u@@ su@@ ally very qui@@ et , isn &apos;t he ?
why is au@@ tu@@ m@@ n called &quot; f@@ all &quot; in A@@ mer@@ ic@@ a ?
in my opinion , he is correc@@ t .
I have enough money to buy it .
are there any ban@@ an@@ as ?
he is a scienti@@ st .
Tom wanted me to learn French .
the C@@ old W@@ ar end@@ ed when the S@@ o@@ vi@@ et U@@ ni@@ on coll@@ ap@@ sed .

your w@@ ish is a comm@@ and for me .
he would not take the money .

Tom never gi@@ ves anything to any@@ body .
H@@ el@@ en K@@ el@@ ler was bl@@ ind , d@@ ea@@ f and du@@ m@@ b .
she didn &apos;t exac@@ tly ag@@ ree with me .
I am won@@ der@@ ing if I could be of any ser@@ vice to you .

I like all of the s@@ on@@ gs Tom sin@@ gs .
D@@ e@@ f@@ en@@ es@@ tr@@ ate your clo@@ ck to see how time f@@ li@@ es .
Tom has a bl@@ ack cat .
any@@ way , if you want to know more about my country , I &apos;ll s@@ end you a letter when I get home .

it r@@ ains so@@ f@@ tly on the c@@ ity .
more and more young people are going under the k@@ ni@@ fe to im@@ pro@@ ve their ph@@ y@@ si@@ cal ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance .
I would like to trav@@ el alone .
she is more char@@ ming that the oth@@ ers .
it &apos;s your dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance that makes you compl@@ et@@ ely in@@ suff@@ er@@ able .
he g@@ ets a h@@ ai@@ r@@ cut three times a mon@@ th .

I loo@@ ked , but I didn &apos;t see anything .
all of them say so , but I believe n@@ one of them .
the her@@ o@@ in isn &apos;t a good thing , stay away from it !
I &apos;m cel@@ e@@ br@@ ating .
I can &apos;t remember where I par@@ ked the car .
wh@@ at@@ ever you do , don &apos;t s@@ mi@@ le .
it would be better for bo@@ th of us not to see each other anymore .
no one could sol@@ ve the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le .
wom@@ en are ph@@ y@@ si@@ c@@ ally wea@@ k@@ er than m@@ en .
I feel like such an idi@@ ot .

you look like a la@@ w@@ yer .
would you like a little help ?
I knew you &apos;d know where to find Tom .
I &apos;m gl@@ ad I lear@@ ned English .
we can &apos;t do this again .
are you hur@@ t ?
that &apos;s the re@@ as@@ on she &apos;s late .
I was spea@@ king to you .

p@@ us@@ h the bu@@ tt@@ on here .
sol@@ der@@ ing S@@ M@@ T com@@ pon@@ ents re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es a bit more ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence than sol@@ der@@ ing th@@ rough @-@ ho@@ le com@@ pon@@ ents .
I asked my teacher what I should do next .
English is my f@@ avo@@ ri@@ te sub@@ j@@ ect in hi@@ gh school .
it would be better if you work this af@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
if for some re@@ as@@ on that should happen , what would you do ?
Sami sle@@ pt in his t@@ ent .
the restaurant we went to wasn &apos;t as ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve as I exp@@ ected it to be .
they ap@@ poin@@ ted him as a direc@@ tor .
al@@ most everything has been im@@ pro@@ ved .
I really like this one .
we found one lar@@ ge fo@@ o@@ t@@ prin@@ t and a cou@@ ple of differ@@ ent si@@ ze sm@@ aller fo@@ o@@ t@@ prin@@ ts .
do you plan to buy that car ?
does that make any sen@@ se ?
they were ta@@ ken pri@@ s@@ on@@ er .
what is the t@@ all@@ est m@@ oun@@ tain in E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe ?
Tom lost his gl@@ ass@@ es some@@ where in the gar@@ d@@ en .
he has been to France .
you can take wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever ro@@ ad you like .
S@@ ally rec@@ all@@ ed the days when her grand@@ ma was str@@ ong and heal@@ th@@ y .
why don &apos;t you ask M@@ r W@@ hi@@ te ?
try to be more p@@ un@@ c@@ tu@@ al from now on .
when I r@@ un , I get sw@@ e@@ at@@ y .
I have to go .
have you ever had a lo@@ ver who was never in the way ?
I &apos;ve already f@@ illed out the for@@ m .
br@@ ing an u@@ m@@ br@@ el@@ la without for@@ getting .
I &apos;d pre@@ f@@ er to di@@ e ra@@ ther than give up .
Tom doesn &apos;t like mat@@ h .
she ad@@ vis@@ ed him to talk about his life in the U@@ n@@ ited S@@ t@@ ates .
she turned her eyes away .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll be f@@ ine .
where have you been up to now ?
you never have any dou@@ b@@ ts , do you ?
Tom bu@@ r@@ st out l@@ augh@@ ing .
I can not aff@@ or@@ d to buy a used car .
we cau@@ ght him red @-@ hand@@ ed .
I &apos;m sorry I had to leave you alone .
I had nothing to do with that .
I never go out .
in about ten minutes , you &apos;ll find out more .
I am as@@ king you for pati@@ ence .
it &apos;ll be hard to find a re@@ pl@@ ac@@ ement for him .
it &apos;s cal@@ m .
she was h@@ it by a car .
Tom would &apos;ve made the same dec@@ ision I &apos;m ma@@ king if he were in my sho@@ es .
I have a lar@@ ge be@@ d@@ room .
let the cat out .
I fin@@ ally met her .
I &apos;ll go wh@@ er@@ ever you want me to go .
it is less cold today than it was yesterday .
there have been a lot of compl@@ ain@@ ts about the way Tom be@@ h@@ av@@ es .
we &apos;re not invit@@ ed .
you need to fil@@ ter the out@@ put of this comm@@ and in or@@ der to dis@@ play only the l@@ in@@ es with &quot; fo@@ o &quot; in@@ side .
he has a d@@ augh@@ ter who is very pre@@ tty .
don &apos;t th@@ row the ball n@@ ear the windo@@ ws .
the E@@ ar@@ th is like a ball with a lar@@ ge mag@@ n@@ et in@@ side .
that &apos;s just what I nee@@ ded .
prom@@ ise me you won &apos;t tell her .
I don &apos;t care who we give it to .
we want fu@@ r@@ ther information .
I could har@@ d@@ ly end@@ ure the pain .
don &apos;t back away .
this doesn &apos;t look good .
I cau@@ ght a beautiful bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ ly .
French was the language of di@@ pl@@ om@@ ac@@ y .
I can &apos;t tell you how ang@@ ry that makes me .
what do you love ? what do you hate ?
how much is your h@@ our@@ ly pay ?
how could I lie to you ?
he was a F@@ ren@@ ch@@ man . I could tell by his acc@@ ent .
I will never understand .
we &apos;ll respon@@ d .
as my father and my grand@@ father have many si@@ bl@@ ings , there are a lot of k@@ ids in our family .
did you see him go out ?
Sami has been married six times .
my father does not eat much fr@@ u@@ it .
the ver@@ b &quot; to be &quot; has an ir@@ re@@ gu@@ l@@ ar con@@ ju@@ g@@ ation in all langu@@ ages .
do you want me to re@@ pe@@ at the question ?
do I have to go now ?
a home is more than a m@@ e@@ re bu@@ il@@ ding .
have you already e@@ at@@ en ?
it &apos;s really aw@@ es@@ o@@ me .
he always ta@@ kes L@@ รฉ@@ a on his la@@ p to read her a story .
I don &apos;t go out much .
Tom is not a true w@@ arri@@ or .
Tom nee@@ ds lo@@ ts of cour@@ age and pers@@ ever@@ ance because he has to pay attention to so many things at the same time .
I &apos;m reading a letter .
it must &apos;ve co@@ st a for@@ t@@ une .
th@@ ank you for invit@@ ing me to dinner .
I want to know what you &apos;re thin@@ king .
don &apos;t be afraid of the dog who bar@@ ks , but be afraid of the one who is sil@@ ent and w@@ ag@@ s its t@@ ai@@ l .
what did you just say ?
they make a great tea@@ m .
the se@@ par@@ ati@@ sts think that I &apos;m k@@ id@@ ding .
the bicy@@ cle is mine .
we think we &apos;ve found a way to help you .
I am ap@@ pl@@ ying for a job .
that &apos;s not what happened here .
I ate some pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts .
I use the In@@ tern@@ et as a res@@ our@@ ce for my res@@ ear@@ ch .
he said he was po@@ or .
she thin@@ ks about him all the time .
he has his own room .
I don &apos;t know who el@@ se to turn to for help .
this dr@@ aw@@ ing took me fi@@ ve minutes , but I took si@@ x@@ ty years to get there .
I don &apos;t want to live by your ru@@ les .
I didn &apos;t stop .
she took the ne@@ ws cal@@ m@@ ly .
how &apos;s everybody doing ?
we &apos;re was@@ ting time .
what did you get h@@ it with ?
car@@ s are ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve .
they were not im@@ pr@@ ess@@ ed .
to tell the truth , I dro@@ ve my father &apos;s car without his per@@ mis@@ sion .
he is Jap@@ an@@ ese to the b@@ one .
we go@@ tt@@ a have all the d@@ at@@ a in there .
she doesn &apos;t want him to buy an ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve en@@ g@@ ag@@ ement r@@ ing .
I think it &apos;s time for me to get my own place .
you know what you must do .
he is t@@ wi@@ ce as old as she is .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
is this what you were looking for ?
write in the d@@ ate yourself .
there is no hope .
cut that out !
I have to put my sho@@ es on .
Tom is an ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ect , right ?
were you busy ?
I de@@ fe@@ ated the w@@ arri@@ or .
you are not the only one respon@@ sible for it , I am too .
I never wanted this .
I try to trav@@ el with only one su@@ it@@ c@@ ase .
you &apos;re was@@ ting bo@@ th of our time .
early ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ers used the star@@ s for n@@ av@@ ig@@ ation .
his sal@@ ary is too low to sup@@ port his family on .
this is a very time @-@ con@@ su@@ ming t@@ ask .
your phone is r@@ in@@ g@@ ing again .
Tom wants to mar@@ ry Mary .
who asked you to do that ?
have a pi@@ e@@ ce of p@@ ie .
long , long ag@@ o , there liv@@ ed an old man in a v@@ illage .
let &apos;s wal@@ k a little f@@ as@@ ter .
I know exac@@ tly where I am .
my m@@ om bought me this to@@ y when I was ei@@ ght years old .
I hope we &apos;re not ma@@ king a hu@@ ge mist@@ ake .
brea@@ k@@ fast is ser@@ ved .
this is il@@ le@@ g@@ al .
I &apos;m not in the mo@@ od to go for a wal@@ k .
I &apos;d like to see that r@@ ing , please .
are you sure you want to leave without s@@ ay@@ ing go@@ o@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e ?
we man@@ ag@@ ed to s@@ wi@@ m ac@@ ro@@ ss the ri@@ ver .
Mary wants to bre@@ as@@ t@@ fe@@ ed her b@@ ab@@ y , but she &apos;s not ma@@ king enough mil@@ k .
who is he talking to ?
what &apos;s the best cu@@ re for lon@@ el@@ in@@ ess ?
would you mind spea@@ king more s@@ low@@ ly ?
do you want to stay here all night ?

I like the m@@ el@@ o@@ dy of this s@@ ong .

bir@@ ds have sh@@ ar@@ p vis@@ ion .
who is Tom ?
Mary took the co@@ ok@@ ies out of the o@@ v@@ en .
he doesn &apos;t know how to write a letter in English .
he is something of a cel@@ e@@ bri@@ ty .
life is a m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ y to be liv@@ ed , not a problem to be sol@@ ved .
I won &apos;t be able to stop .

you do like liv@@ ing danger@@ ous@@ ly .
s@@ pr@@ ing has re@@ turned . the E@@ ar@@ th is like a child that knows po@@ ems .
what did I do wrong ?
W@@ i@@ pe your t@@ ears .
it took me more than two hours to trans@@ late a few p@@ ages of English .
it &apos;s getting har@@ der for me to con@@ c@@ entr@@ ate .
I &apos;m not cre@@ ati@@ ve .
the books were so v@@ al@@ u@@ able that they were hand@@ led with the gre@@ at@@ est care .
they have lost a lot .
looks like we bar@@ ked up the wrong t@@ ree .
I have questions .
I didn &apos;t star@@ t all this .
I w@@ ish you could have come with me .
as a matter of fac@@ t , all great dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ers have been re@@ gar@@ ded as dre@@ am@@ ers .
th@@ ank you , I &apos;d like to stay in your house .
I prom@@ ise that you won &apos;t be dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted .
can you dri@@ ve man@@ u@@ al ?
Tom seems very happy .
show me how to do that .
I m@@ ess@@ ed up .
I think I did something wrong .
Tom has already told Mary not to do that anymore .
he &apos;s a ch@@ ain smo@@ k@@ er .
P@@ eas@@ ants often have a secon@@ d@@ ary acti@@ v@@ ity to au@@ g@@ ment their in@@ come .
our pass@@ por@@ ts were can@@ cel@@ led .
me@@ dic@@ ine should be out of the way of children .
that word des@@ cri@@ b@@ es it per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly .
he wor@@ ks for her .
help me out here .
where do you live in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ey ?
why are you so c@@ lu@@ m@@ s@@ y ?
help me .
don &apos;t stay here .
the nei@@ gh@@ bo@@ r &apos;s dog is always bar@@ king .
I plan to go to her co@@ ck@@ t@@ ai@@ l party .
Tom has ag@@ re@@ ed to help us .
I &apos;m sup@@ er hun@@ gr@@ y .
we &apos;re getting no@@ where with those probl@@ ems .
it &apos;s my fau@@ l@@ t !
if the situation doesn &apos;t im@@ pro@@ ve , I &apos;ll be o@@ bli@@ g@@ ed to take m@@ ea@@ su@@ r@@ es .
I have an u@@ m@@ br@@ el@@ la in my car .
wh@@ ose sho@@ es are these ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat be@@ e@@ f .
do you know where he went ?
the b@@ ear is big .
I &apos;ll take your su@@ it@@ c@@ ase to your room , si@@ r .
it &apos;s as you say .
the door nee@@ ds another co@@ at of pain@@ t .
I told you so !
he always went f@@ is@@ h@@ ing on the ri@@ ver when he was young .
he has three s@@ ons .
could you please tell me again how many times you &apos;ve been here ?
if you wanted to im@@ pro@@ ve your S@@ pan@@ ish , you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have come to C@@ hi@@ le .
I know you like to trav@@ el .
Tom would just like to know what he did wrong .
when did he come here ?
I &apos;ll keep this c@@ ake for myself .
don &apos;t talk back to me like that .
this sum@@ mer we &apos;ll go to the m@@ oun@@ t@@ ains and to the se@@ a .
as far as I know , he has never come on time .
he av@@ en@@ g@@ ed the mu@@ r@@ der of his father .
my watch lo@@ ses ten minutes a day .
he is compl@@ et@@ ely bes@@ o@@ t@@ ted with her .
let &apos;s do it your way .
it &apos;s so hot out@@ side that I want to s@@ pend all day in my air con@@ di@@ ti@@ on@@ ed house .
I was f@@ al@@ sel@@ y acc@@ used .
he didn &apos;t know how to ex@@ pr@@ ess himself .
Tom said Mary was happy .
someone was k@@ illed .
she will make us a nice dinner .
you &apos;re sure there &apos;s no way ?
I heard them coming .
I had a h@@ ea@@ d@@ a@@ che , so I couldn &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s a@@ h@@ ead of s@@ che@@ du@@ le .
Tom r@@ ar@@ ely hu@@ gs Mary anymore .
she didn &apos;t want him to play po@@ k@@ er .
when we look at other pl@@ ac@@ es in the uni@@ ver@@ se , it could very well be that pho@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ c life is the exc@@ ep@@ tion .
it &apos;s true that it would be eas@@ ier for stu@@ dents if there were only one sin@@ g@@ le S@@ pan@@ ish di@@ al@@ ect , but that &apos;s qu@@ ite far from being the c@@ ase .
I won &apos;t r@@ un away like a co@@ ward .
where &apos;s your d@@ augh@@ ter ?
you must take your parents ad@@ vice ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ly .
I &apos;ll get there before you .
he came to meet me yesterday af@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
I haven &apos;t told the k@@ ids yet that we &apos;re getting di@@ v@@ or@@ ced .
let me car@@ ry it for you .
I pre@@ f@@ er to write in French .

someone was here .
I don &apos;t care what he does .
I &apos;ll go take a sho@@ w@@ er now .
the house clo@@ s@@ est to here is two mil@@ es away .
her age qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ es her for the job .
he ac@@ ted like a lun@@ ati@@ c .
they can &apos;t do that .
are you list@@ en@@ ing ?
I could really make things hard for you , you know .
you &apos;ve ris@@ ked enough .
you knew that already , didn &apos;t you ?
I gave my brother a dic@@ ti@@ on@@ ary .
if I &apos;d only ta@@ ken your ad@@ vice !
she &apos;s well st@@ ac@@ ked .
Sami thin@@ ks he did very well in the ex@@ am .
I didn &apos;t study at all yesterday .
you can &apos;t leave us like this .
one of my plea@@ su@@ r@@ es is wat@@ ching T@@ V .
we need to get out of here .
were there any star@@ s in the sk@@ y ?
Tom apo@@ lo@@ gi@@ z@@ ed .
I just wanted to see if I could do it .
the fo@@ g is gro@@ w@@ ing th@@ ic@@ k@@ er .
I don &apos;t know any@@ body in Boston .
I &apos;m a lu@@ ck@@ y man .
E@@ ar@@ ning our cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence and resp@@ ect is this fir@@ m &apos;s obj@@ ec@@ tive .
what will the nei@@ gh@@ b@@ ors think ?
you can &apos;t pro@@ ve a thing .
this school sup@@ p@@ li@@ es stu@@ dents with t@@ ex@@ t@@ books .
his d@@ el@@ ay of coming here on time is du@@ e to a tr@@ aff@@ ic accident .
we need a str@@ at@@ e@@ g@@ y .
Jap@@ an has a lot of tr@@ ade with C@@ an@@ ad@@ a .
sh@@ ut the windo@@ w to pre@@ v@@ ent c@@ at@@ ching a cold .

he l@@ ac@@ ks t@@ act .
we were concer@@ ned .
A@@ chi@@ ev@@ ing a nice w@@ el@@ d b@@ ead is not with@@ in everyone &apos;s re@@ ac@@ h !

we el@@ ected Tom cap@@ tain of the tea@@ m .
I &apos;m very sorry I got home so late .
f@@ un@@ n@@ y !
I can &apos;t do that .
she hand@@ ed me a pos@@ t@@ c@@ ard .
I just have to do something .
nobody in@@ su@@ l@@ ts my country .
do you have any kind of ali@@ b@@ i ?
I think you would like it here .
his answ@@ er was f@@ av@@ or@@ able .
how many col@@ ours are there ?
the language of fri@@ end@@ shi@@ p is not wor@@ ds but me@@ an@@ ings .
if you want my help , you &apos;ll have to ask for it .
I sp@@ ent a week with a P@@ al@@ es@@ tin@@ i@@ an family from G@@ az@@ a .

Tom was aw@@ fu@@ l@@ ly bo@@ red .
the nu@@ ll h@@ y@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is st@@ ates how often a s@@ am@@ pl@@ ing er@@ ro@@ r alone will produ@@ ce res@@ ul@@ ts that are differ@@ ent than a fo@@ rec@@ ast .
at the party there was food in ab@@ un@@ d@@ ance .
I want you to speak fran@@ k@@ ly .
they are see@@ ing their un@@ cle tomorrow .
I &apos;m on the inter@@ st@@ ate .

I couldn &apos;t en@@ ter because the door was clo@@ sed .

inst@@ ead of going to school , he st@@ ay@@ ed at home .
I w@@ ish you were here with me now .
Tom asked me for more money than he really nee@@ ded .
I must br@@ us@@ h up my English .
it is in the restaurant where Dan e@@ ats lun@@ ch .
they g@@ ang@@ ed up on him .
you don &apos;t understand what &apos;s hap@@ pen@@ ing .
Tom ru@@ m@@ mag@@ ed th@@ rough the dr@@ aw@@ er , looking for a pen@@ c@@ il .
do you need a ri@@ de home l@@ ater ?
I took the little girl by the hand .
my father sp@@ ends a lot of time on his ho@@ b@@ by .
you che@@ ated .
do you know how to play the piano ?
I wanted to make sure you were all right .
you &apos;ve found it .
I don &apos;t understand your res@@ ist@@ ance .
M@@ on@@ days aren &apos;t good for me .
the wea@@ ther today is wor@@ se than yesterday .
I plan to have lun@@ ch with him .
she is wat@@ er@@ ing the f@@ low@@ ers .
I think Tom e@@ ats too much me@@ at .
what direc@@ tion are you going ?
I w@@ ish there were a French trans@@ l@@ ation of this book .
down came the rain in tor@@ ren@@ ts .
she tried to com@@ for@@ t him , but he k@@ ep@@ t cr@@ ying .
that won &apos;t change anything .
the most was@@ ted day of all is that on which we have not l@@ augh@@ ed .
the way tou@@ ri@@ sts dress off@@ ends lo@@ cal st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds of pro@@ pri@@ et@@ y .
we can &apos;t give up .

they want someone to help them .
I &apos;m too tired to ar@@ gue .
that li@@ es out@@ side my ar@@ e@@ a of study .
my un@@ cle has a house in I@@ tal@@ y .
she turned down my off@@ er .
Tom has three bo@@ ys and a girl .
my bo@@ y@@ friend looks like your gir@@ l@@ friend .
Tom was in the sho@@ w@@ er .

I don &apos;t want to miss my train .

he has money .
we had lun@@ ch ear@@ li@@ er than u@@ su@@ al and went out at tw@@ el@@ ve thir@@ ty .
they were pl@@ ain@@ ly dres@@ sed .

why don &apos;t you believe them ?
b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its of cour@@ se should exc@@ e@@ ed the co@@ sts .

I thought Tom had ag@@ re@@ ed to do the job .
what should I eat ?

he may not be able to come .
the doctor se@@ i@@ z@@ ed the pati@@ ent &apos;s hand and said : &quot; so how do we feel today ? &quot;
where are you from ?

I &apos;m sorry to be so late . the meeting compl@@ et@@ ely s@@ li@@ p@@ ped my mind .
I didn &apos;t re@@ ali@@ ze you could speak French .
where did you get that or@@ ange s@@ car@@ f ?
the story turned my b@@ lo@@ od cold .

how did you come by this pain@@ ting ?
how much did they give you for your old car ?
he married a pre@@ tty girl .
I &apos;m sure you don &apos;t want to do that .
you only think about having fun .
I cannot make no@@ ise . the b@@ ab@@ y is sle@@ ep@@ ing .
how do you d@@ ea@@ l with it ?
let &apos;s wait an h@@ our .
I r@@ an into an old friend of mine at the party the other day .
I won@@ der what it could be .
are you sure you don &apos;t want one ?
I br@@ ought you another bl@@ an@@ k@@ et .
S@@ am is two years y@@ oun@@ ger than Tom .
I met her by chance at a restaurant yesterday .
you are in Boston .
that &apos;s not your problem anymore .
I know that you are busy .
you are a doctor .
will the train leave on time ?
I &apos;m w@@ ill@@ ing to help you if you want me to .
I don &apos;t know how to des@@ cri@@ be it .
Mary always y@@ el@@ ls when she &apos;s ang@@ ry .
Tom tried to hu@@ la ho@@ o@@ p .
per@@ hap@@ s you are mist@@ a@@ ken .
if the times go ag@@ ain@@ st you , th@@ en go with the times .
when I en@@ ter@@ ed the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , she was ma@@ king ch@@ ic@@ ken cu@@ r@@ ry with ri@@ ce .
I am th@@ rough with my work .
who is the man s@@ it@@ ting in the cor@@ ner ?
my parents har@@ d@@ ly ever p@@ un@@ is@@ hed me for anything .
we must ab@@ an@@ don shi@@ p .
the off@@ ici@@ al we dis@@ char@@ g@@ ed of his o@@ bli@@ g@@ ations .
I had no idea Tom would do that .
his le@@ gs are long .
Mary was lu@@ ck@@ y to find her k@@ ey@@ s .
it beg@@ an to s@@ now .
why are you doing that today ?
who were you talking to ?
this is a pres@@ ent for you .
what &apos;s the fun in this ?
did Tom see that ?
I had a little help from a friend .
you may cho@@ ose wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever you want .
I never tal@@ ked to him again .
he &apos;s k@@ ic@@ king me !
this concer@@ t was aw@@ es@@ o@@ me .
what is life without the ra@@ di@@ ance of love ?
this is the un@@ for@@ get@@ table place where we met each other for the first time .
it is , I think , an in@@ dis@@ pu@@ table fac@@ t that A@@ mer@@ ic@@ ans are , as A@@ mer@@ ic@@ ans , the most self @-@ con@@ sci@@ ous people in the world , and the most ad@@ dic@@ ted to the beli@@ e@@ f that the other n@@ ations of the ear@@ th are in a con@@ sp@@ ir@@ ac@@ y to under@@ v@@ al@@ ue them .
we &apos;re su@@ n@@ k .
do not under@@ es@@ ti@@ m@@ ate my po@@ w@@ er .
I can &apos;t play tennis as well as I used to .
this is fu@@ c@@ ked up .
I b@@ et you &apos;re right .
have some coffee .
un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , they are very po@@ or@@ ly e@@ du@@ c@@ ated people .
the wri@@ ter does not always pres@@ ent life as it is .
language and cul@@ ture can &apos;t be se@@ par@@ ated .
nobody car@@ es for me .
there is a ta@@ x@@ i stand n@@ ear the station .
if C@@ le@@ op@@ a@@ tr@@ a &apos;s no@@ se had been sh@@ or@@ ter , the hi@@ story of the world would be differ@@ ent .
his room was small but c@@ le@@ an , and the food was good .
his sle@@ ev@@ e tou@@ ch@@ ed the gre@@ as@@ y p@@ an .
it &apos;s a s@@ ac@@ red right .
I think Tom can do that .
they are all very happy .
why don &apos;t you understand ?
I have children .
S@@ m@@ ith has sp@@ ent years stu@@ d@@ ying the eff@@ ec@@ ts of sleep and sleep lo@@ ss on m@@ em@@ ory and lear@@ ning .
I did everything I could do .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ll have time to do it .
we want to help .
you don &apos;t need to wor@@ ry anymore .
where is your father ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to get a bit of ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se .
the cat ru@@ in@@ ed my so@@ f@@ a .
we &apos;re less than h@@ al@@ f@@ way to the to@@ p of the m@@ oun@@ tain . are you already tired ?
con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations !
I &apos;m re@@ gu@@ lar@@ ly feel@@ ing down in the du@@ m@@ ps .
they &apos;re all on vac@@ ation .
if you can , come with us .
I tr@@ ust Tom &apos;s ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment .
I go home .
I &apos;ve been asked to be@@ come the man@@ ager .
a cro@@ w@@ d was g@@ ath@@ er@@ ing around him .
I &apos;ll do it tomorrow .
she died of tu@@ b@@ er@@ cu@@ lo@@ s@@ is .
it was your mist@@ ake .
it was very ru@@ de of you to say a thing like that .
these t@@ ex@@ ts were wri@@ tten in H@@ e@@ bre@@ w , not in A@@ r@@ am@@ ai@@ c .
you look fam@@ ili@@ ar . do I know you ?
we must do it again .
she made a t@@ our of A@@ mer@@ ic@@ a , st@@ op@@ ping in six ci@@ ti@@ es .
M@@ r@@ . Y@@ oun@@ g w@@ is@@ h@@ es his son would study har@@ der .
I have no fau@@ l@@ ts .
please sig@@ n here .
I need a little help here .
you &apos;re going to have to pay for the re@@ p@@ air .
take things as they are .
it is r@@ ain@@ ing now .
you &apos;re too su@@ sp@@ ici@@ ous about everything .
so t@@ as@@ ty !
I &apos;ve never had probl@@ ems before .
I probab@@ ly should have said something .
don &apos;t mi@@ x the di@@ sh@@ clo@@ th@@ s with the ser@@ vi@@ et@@ tes .
I thought he would be u@@ p@@ set .
I had no idea there were so many people in the other room .
H@@ er@@ o@@ ing is one of the sh@@ or@@ t@@ est @-@ liv@@ ed prof@@ es@@ si@@ ons there is .
the mil@@ k is s@@ our .
does anyone speak English ?
he ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ed to us for help .
why did you let me sleep so late ?
it may be im@@ possible to get a compl@@ et@@ ely er@@ ro@@ r @-@ free cor@@ p@@ us du@@ e to the nat@@ ure of this kind of coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ati@@ ve effor@@ t . H@@ o@@ w@@ ever , if we en@@ cour@@ age m@@ em@@ b@@ ers to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te senten@@ ces in their own langu@@ ages ra@@ ther than ex@@ per@@ i@@ ment in langu@@ ages they are lear@@ ning , we might be able to min@@ im@@ i@@ ze er@@ r@@ ors .
that is the wor@@ st thing you can do !
has he got any ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence of f@@ ar@@ ming ?
Tom knows the c@@ ity very well .
you could &apos;ve ru@@ in@@ ed everything .
because they &apos;re wat@@ ching tel@@ ev@@ ision .
we &apos;ve just finished brea@@ k@@ fast .
write your ad@@ dress here .
that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to do .
he was a w@@ and@@ er@@ ing pe@@ d@@ d@@ ler .
Tom wal@@ ks s@@ low@@ ly .
keep pr@@ acti@@ c@@ ing , Tom .
I &apos;d like to talk to you for a minu@@ te .

I was married .
he doesn &apos;t have his me@@ dic@@ ation .

it go@@ es without s@@ ay@@ ing that hon@@ es@@ ty is the k@@ ey to succ@@ ess .
time to ri@@ se and sh@@ ine .
he did it any@@ way .
the pay is terri@@ ble and the hours are long .
how old is the uni@@ ver@@ se ?
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary everything .
my wife is six mon@@ th@@ s pre@@ gn@@ ant with our first son .
this is hard for me .

I miss his k@@ is@@ s .

Tom is t@@ all , but not as t@@ all as I am .
do you think it gi@@ ves me plea@@ sure to not have time to look after my children ?
how about star@@ ting again from the very beg@@ in@@ ning ?
can you look at these two pic@@ tures and tell me which one is better ?
I &apos;m done with you .
I never said this job would be easy .
I &apos;ve got nothing to say .

Tom married an ol@@ der woman .
every mo@@ v@@ ement is pain@@ ful .
she li@@ ked everything about him .
I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s wrong with her .
I did war@@ n you .

I can &apos;t go to the restaurant with you ton@@ ight .

it won &apos;t be long before they get married .
no one could see us .
we &apos;re ready now .

we have to ask everybody this .
he got his d@@ and@@ er up .
it &apos;s a fr@@ u@@ it .
I &apos;m l@@ ying on the gr@@ ass .
you &apos;ve got to answ@@ er the question .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe in life after de@@ ath .
I &apos;m tired of e@@ ating at the school c@@ af@@ et@@ er@@ i@@ a .
sum@@ mer is coming to an end .

she will be able to answ@@ er your question .
how long have you been here for ?
there are many people trying to buy h@@ ou@@ ses .
it &apos;s in the gar@@ age .
you talk really fast .
that &apos;s not really a so@@ lution .

what do you think this is made of ?
I need to ask a few questions .

Tom likes te@@ ch@@ no@@ log@@ y .
what do you think he did ?
the pl@@ ant is b@@ lu@@ e .
we &apos;re getting out of here .

ac@@ id rain is not a nat@@ ur@@ al ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
we should pres@@ er@@ ve the be@@ au@@ ti@@ es of the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
I can get us there more qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
I don &apos;t think Tom can play the tru@@ m@@ p@@ et .
I think that fac@@ t is very important .

Tom told me he &apos;d already e@@ at@@ en .
I &apos;ll do wh@@ at@@ ever you want .
she pl@@ ays the f@@ lu@@ te .

she has inter@@ n@@ ation@@ al ren@@ own as a pain@@ ter .
I saw Tom s@@ li@@ p and f@@ all .
take your co@@ at off and make yourself at home .
a man &apos;s wor@@ th li@@ es not so much in what he has as in what he is .
I am aw@@ k@@ ward with num@@ b@@ ers .
do you have any idea who did this ?
I bu@@ il@@ t this do@@ gh@@ ou@@ se by myself .
Tom couldn &apos;t go to the concer@@ t because he had to work .
he &apos;s bro@@ ke .
she is far from hon@@ est .
there are good gr@@ oun@@ ds for the vie@@ w that Paris was the s@@ cen@@ e of f@@ re@@ qu@@ ent ri@@ o@@ ts even before the re@@ vo@@ lution of 1@@ 7@@ 8@@ 9 .

I like these h@@ ats .
we &apos;ll dec@@ ide l@@ ater .
last win@@ ter , I went sk@@ i@@ ing in C@@ an@@ ad@@ a .

Sami has had a hard day .
don &apos;t exp@@ ect anyone to help you .

I think Tom is a nice name .
I don &apos;t know who did that .
I write everything down ; I feel un@@ easy without my no@@ te@@ book .

you are good .
I don &apos;t see much cho@@ ice .
I just don &apos;t want to see you get hur@@ t .
are you married or sin@@ g@@ le ? do you live alone or are you in a rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p ?

P@@ ee@@ ing s@@ it@@ ting down is not all that bad .
ch@@ ec@@ k these out .

we always have enough time if we use it correc@@ tly .
Tom is as t@@ all as any stu@@ dent in his cl@@ ass is .
as yet , everything has been going well .
gu@@ ess what happened to me .
your fu@@ ture beg@@ ins today .
I think it &apos;s danger@@ ous for children to s@@ wi@@ m in this l@@ ake .
everybody knows his name .
your sister &apos;s sle@@ ep@@ ing .
you &apos;ve bought more st@@ am@@ ps than n@@ ec@@ ess@@ ary .

I want to meet with Tom .
it al@@ most s@@ car@@ ed me not to see you on@@ l@@ ine for a wh@@ ole day .

do you h@@ it your children ?
be@@ au@@ ty pl@@ eas@@ es the eyes , k@@ in@@ d@@ ness en@@ ch@@ ants the sou@@ l .
our plan went wrong from the beg@@ in@@ ning .
I don &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y tea@@ ching children to s@@ wi@@ m when their parents are around .
this is one of the re@@ as@@ ons why I love Tatoeba .
do you still need te@@ a ?
a child should not get more sp@@ end@@ ing money than is n@@ ec@@ ess@@ ary .
the pi@@ z@@ z@@ a is cold .
&quot; are you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; so I am . &quot;
I was sur@@ pri@@ sed by his su@@ d@@ d@@ en ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance .
no one could den@@ y this .
Tom r@@ an out of mat@@ ches so he couldn &apos;t light the fi@@ re .
I &apos;ve never been to a prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al b@@ as@@ eb@@ all g@@ ame .
Tom &apos;s in@@ no@@ cent .

I &apos;d like to get away from Boston for a few days .
Tom is j@@ e@@ al@@ ous .
please re@@ f@@ er to the tou@@ ri@@ st information office .
don &apos;t leave the fr@@ ont door open .

we want to leave .
I &apos;m sorry for re@@ pro@@ ach@@ ing you .
does Tom still r@@ ely on his parents ?
I don &apos;t believe it happened that way .
I &apos;m no friend of y@@ ours .
I just wanted cl@@ ar@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ation .
let &apos;s wor@@ ry about that l@@ ater .
he hur@@ t his fin@@ ger with a nee@@ d@@ le .

I fi@@ gu@@ red out a way to make more money .
this job gi@@ ves me the hu@@ m@@ p .
I didn &apos;t tell you everything .

&quot; so , you &apos;ll go out with me if I don &apos;t have to re@@ pe@@ at a year ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t care for &apos; what if &apos; sto@@ ri@@ es . &quot;

Tom put on his co@@ at and left .

we &apos;re as@@ h@@ am@@ ed of our father &apos;s po@@ ver@@ ty .

I didn &apos;t know where Tom was going , but I had a good idea where he might be going .
I &apos;ve been working on this for mon@@ th@@ s .

his father won &apos;t come . he &apos;s very busy .
the pati@@ ent was dis@@ char@@ g@@ ed from ho@@ sp@@ ital .
do you think Tom can re@@ turn ?
I have no money to buy the dic@@ ti@@ on@@ ary .
Sami re@@ f@@ used to talk .
I hope you &apos;re happy , too .
I had no place el@@ se to go .
I had been stu@@ d@@ ying mus@@ ic in Boston before I re@@ turned to Jap@@ an .
she vis@@ ited the old man in the ho@@ sp@@ ital every day but S@@ un@@ day .
she came to Jap@@ an for the pu@@ r@@ pose of stu@@ d@@ ying Jap@@ an@@ ese .
please take your time before dec@@ i@@ ding what to do .
I was ab@@ du@@ c@@ ted and im@@ pre@@ gn@@ ated by w@@ ol@@ ves who l@@ and@@ ed their fl@@ ying s@@ au@@ c@@ er in my b@@ ac@@ k@@ y@@ ard .
why did G@@ od cre@@ ate the uni@@ ver@@ se ?
p@@ ass me the su@@ g@@ ar , please .
that was co@@ ol .
is this one of your cre@@ ations ?
there was a he@@ av@@ y rain last night .
let her go .
there &apos;s been another accident .
didn &apos;t I m@@ en@@ tion that ?
I didn &apos;t tell him you were coming .
the man was young .
anyone can do it .
he is still having dou@@ b@@ ts .
they like English .
list@@ en to me , he said col@@ d@@ ly , my father was the king of K@@ ak@@ on@@ go .
this dress would look good on you .
I &apos;m tel@@ ling you the truth .
she w@@ o@@ re a red bl@@ ou@@ se .
I st@@ ay@@ ed home for a week .
you may be right .
always .
that &apos;s so@@ ft .
the to@@ wn was fu@@ ll of acti@@ v@@ ity .
leave him alone .
I had no in@@ ten@@ tion of doing so .
the E@@ ar@@ th and S@@ un are just tin@@ y do@@ ts am@@ ong the b@@ il@@ li@@ ons of star@@ s in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y .
I su@@ gg@@ est we go out for a drink .
m@@ ay@@ be you should just leave Tom alone .
do you re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ ze the man in this photo ?
I want to jo@@ in your tea@@ m .
don &apos;t speak so fast .
I can hear a cat s@@ cr@@ at@@ ching at the windo@@ w .
there is a c@@ af@@ et@@ er@@ i@@ a in the uni@@ vers@@ ity .
I didn &apos;t know you had so many c@@ ats .
and who was the other ?
they have an ex@@ tr@@ a bed .
you should take care of y@@ our@@ sel@@ ves .
be kind to little anim@@ al@@ s .
I don &apos;t think I could do that .
something is s@@ low@@ ing down my com@@ pu@@ ter .
my com@@ pu@@ ter cr@@ as@@ hed and now it won &apos;t star@@ t up .
when the des@@ ire for le@@ i@@ sure is str@@ on@@ ger than the other ur@@ g@@ es , le@@ i@@ sure w@@ ins .
we still have more than h@@ al@@ f@@ way to go to get to the to@@ p of the m@@ oun@@ tain . are you really already ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ ed ?
few stu@@ dents can read L@@ ati@@ n .
how many hours a day do you s@@ pend in your office ?
I know this is hard for you to understand .
I fin@@ ally found a use for this old thing .
I want to war@@ m myself .
you must do it .
I &apos;m sorry to bo@@ ther you , but we &apos;ve got a small problem .
I ad@@ mi@@ re your det@@ er@@ min@@ ation .
they all went to the restaurant .
I &apos;m sure I can per@@ su@@ ade Tom .
I told you it was going to be cold here .
do you want to talk about anything ?
Tom wants to stay sin@@ g@@ le .
I &apos;m looking for@@ ward to sum@@ mer vac@@ ation .
I made a po@@ t ro@@ ast .
is she still sin@@ g@@ le ?
she is not as beautiful as her ol@@ der sister .
he &apos;s rich as C@@ ro@@ es@@ us .
don &apos;t do@@ d@@ ge the question .
why does Tom want this information ?
what would you say ?
W@@ ho@@ ever kno@@ c@@ ks get o@@ pened up to .
Tom gave me a bicy@@ cle .
Tom seems lost .
he bought a do@@ z@@ en e@@ g@@ gs .
you mi@@ su@@ n@@ der@@ sto@@ od me .
I don &apos;t know ei@@ ther of his bro@@ th@@ ers .
you &apos;re very busy .
they will ho@@ ld tal@@ ks tomorrow .
did you write that ?
I wanted to pro@@ t@@ ect you .
we asked our teacher : &quot; where will the we@@ d@@ ding be hel@@ d ? &quot;
only a mi@@ r@@ ac@@ le may get him out of it .
can I see your dri@@ ver &apos;s lic@@ en@@ se ?
this should sol@@ ve all your probl@@ ems .
the man reading a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er is his father .
I never drink be@@ er before lun@@ ch .
did you have any lu@@ ck ?
I &apos;m a str@@ anger here .
someone th@@ re@@ w a ro@@ ck at him .
he k@@ is@@ sed me on the fo@@ re@@ h@@ ead .
Mar@@ i@@ a didn &apos;t su@@ sp@@ ect that &quot; Tom , &quot; her p@@ en @-@ friend , with wh@@ om she had been cor@@ respon@@ ding for mon@@ th@@ s over the In@@ tern@@ et and wh@@ om she secre@@ tly lo@@ ved , without ever having met him , was ac@@ tu@@ ally a sup@@ er @-@ intelli@@ gent s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ l .
I &apos;m still at school .
how could you do it to me ?
3 cu@@ bed is 2@@ 7 .
how did you get interes@@ ted in ar@@ t ?
a dog sel@@ d@@ om b@@ it@@ es un@@ less it is att@@ ac@@ ked .
it &apos;s something my sister never wanted to do .
Tom main@@ t@@ ain@@ ed that he was in@@ no@@ cent .
he is a man who is f@@ on@@ d of cer@@ em@@ on@@ y .
if only you &apos;d thought of that before sho@@ o@@ ting your big mou@@ th off .
he is very afraid of do@@ gs .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
that is or@@ din@@ ary @-@ looking .
you look p@@ ale as a g@@ ho@@ st .
c@@ at@@ ch you l@@ ater .
I really don &apos;t want to talk about it .
can you help look after the k@@ ids ?
ph@@ il@@ o@@ so@@ ph@@ y is often re@@ gar@@ ded as difficult .
the ra@@ di@@ o doesn &apos;t work .
he died fi@@ ve years ag@@ o .
I knew we should &apos;ve tried to help Tom .
let &apos;s re@@ consi@@ der the problem .
can you help us ?
we did not exp@@ ect him to fin@@ ish the t@@ ask in so sh@@ or@@ t a time .
the sp@@ ace b@@ ar is an al@@ ph@@ an@@ u@@ mer@@ ic@@ al k@@ ey@@ bo@@ ard &apos;s k@@ ey .
that job is im@@ possible for me to do .
there is much su@@ g@@ ar in this bl@@ ack bo@@ x .
our mother had no cho@@ ice but to make dinner with le@@ f@@ to@@ ver@@ s .
these two l@@ in@@ es cut ac@@ ro@@ ss each other at right ang@@ les .
she doesn &apos;t care how she dres@@ ses .
I hate this g@@ ame .

why did you buy another car ?
where did everybody go ?
it &apos;s my bad .
Tom makes big money .
you have lo@@ ts of ph@@ on@@ es .
keep your ey@@ e on the ball .
I bu@@ r@@ ned my hand with an ir@@ on .
that &apos;s im@@ possible .
we love our mother al@@ most without kno@@ w@@ ing it , without feel@@ ing it , as it is as nat@@ ur@@ al as to live .
it s@@ car@@ ed me .
when I &apos;m hot , a gl@@ ass of co@@ ol water really re@@ fr@@ es@@ h@@ es me .
can you tell me where the ne@@ ar@@ est bus stop is ?
the st@@ e@@ w sm@@ el@@ ls d@@ el@@ ici@@ ous .

please give me the book .
I &apos;m a little bit hun@@ gr@@ y .

I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t be by your side du@@ r@@ ing this pain@@ ful or@@ d@@ ea@@ l .

Tom probab@@ ly can &apos;t do that as well as I can .
su@@ g@@ ar is so@@ lu@@ ble in water .
what do you think of Mary &apos;s new dress ?
I have a lot of probl@@ ems .
it &apos;s not enough to m@@ em@@ ori@@ ze the for@@ mu@@ l@@ as . you need to know how to use them .
what &apos;s a beautiful woman like you doing in a place like this ?
what did you exp@@ ect to happen ?
m@@ ay@@ be you &apos;re right , after all .
Mary is f@@ lu@@ ent in Ger@@ man , but with a s@@ light A@@ mer@@ ic@@ an acc@@ ent .
she always exp@@ ec@@ ts me to help her .
go and speak to my col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue .
I do want to see you .
he was s@@ l@@ ain in b@@ att@@ le .
were you busy ?
nobody &apos;s going to bl@@ ame you .
I like c@@ ats .
why don &apos;t you use a h@@ am@@ mer ?
can you still remember the time we first met ?
I re@@ ach@@ ed the h@@ ill@@ to@@ p exac@@ tly at fi@@ ve .

I &apos;d ra@@ ther do this alone .
I can re@@ comm@@ end this restaurant .

why don &apos;t you star@@ t by tel@@ ling us who went with you ?
K@@ ate has been gi@@ v@@ en an op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to play a ma@@ j@@ or ro@@ le in a mo@@ vie .

he wor@@ ks under me .
you have to see it .
if anyone knows anything , please let me know .

there is nothing like cold be@@ er on a hot day .
tell Tom what you me@@ an .
un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , I already have pl@@ ans for that day .
are you sure we have enough be@@ er ?
the wh@@ ole c@@ ity was dev@@ as@@ t@@ ated by water .
I have pl@@ ent@@ y of friends .

igno@@ re him .
it &apos;s his first time .
that would be a good idea .
that would be w@@ ic@@ ked !
I saw a dr@@ un@@ k l@@ ying on the ro@@ ad .
I don &apos;t really feel like reading .
I didn &apos;t have much time .
everything is be@@ coming more and more comp@@ lic@@ ated .
every day you should at le@@ ast list@@ en to a sh@@ or@@ t s@@ ong , read a good po@@ e@@ m , look at a beautiful pic@@ ture , and , if possible , say s@@ ever@@ al intelli@@ gent wor@@ ds .
this is really too much .
I had to leave W@@ ar@@ saw and make my liv@@ ing some@@ where el@@ se .
B@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on was fam@@ ous for its h@@ ang@@ ing gar@@ d@@ ens .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
the en@@ em@@ y dro@@ p@@ ped many b@@ om@@ b@@ s on the fac@@ t@@ ory .
I &apos;m here all the time .
did you understand any of that ?
I have no wor@@ ds .

don &apos;t for@@ get to br@@ ing k@@ it@@ ch@@ en u@@ ten@@ s@@ il@@ s such as k@@ ni@@ ves and co@@ o@@ king po@@ ts .

N@@ a@@ om@@ i has just finished her work .
he married my cou@@ s@@ in .
I had a hard time trying to per@@ su@@ ade him to c@@ anc@@ el the tri@@ p .

in the late 2@@ 0@@ th cen@@ tu@@ ry , Y@@ u@@ go@@ s@@ l@@ av@@ i@@ a was consi@@ der@@ ed a ro@@ gue st@@ ate by the U@@ n@@ ited S@@ t@@ ates .

k@@ ids do stupi@@ d things .
you &apos;re very intelli@@ gent .
it &apos;s all ne@@ go@@ ti@@ able .
she tou@@ ch@@ ed my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der .
she went there yesterday .
there &apos;s a lot of tr@@ aff@@ ic today .
your face is always di@@ r@@ ty .
it happened here .
I &apos;ll fi@@ x a drink .
I &apos;d be dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted if I saw you doing that .
I &apos;ll take the next train .
if we had kno@@ wn that , we would &apos;ve come so@@ on@@ er .
I can &apos;t be man@@ i@@ pu@@ l@@ ated .
what do you think of his su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion ?
open those do@@ ors !
didn &apos;t you read the man@@ u@@ al ?
he wants a play@@ m@@ ate .
she sp@@ ends all of her money on clo@@ th@@ es .
Dan &apos;s m@@ ess@@ age was in@@ su@@ l@@ ting .
we w@@ ouldn &apos;t ask you to do that .
this h@@ at is mine .

that looks like the work of a vir@@ us .
fu@@ ck your m@@ om , b@@ it@@ ch .
he who is not s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed with a little , is s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed with nothing .
why don &apos;t you try a differ@@ ent t@@ ack ?
I have been w@@ an@@ ting to ask you a question .
why not just kno@@ ck on the door ?
in France , where the si@@ te was f@@ oun@@ ded , Tatoeba has be@@ come a cul@@ tu@@ r@@ al and so@@ ci@@ al ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .

do you remember what you were wat@@ ching ?
keep your hand@@ s up .
how fast !
I left it un@@ lo@@ c@@ ked .
go s@@ it in the car .
when I g@@ row up I want to be just like you .
it &apos;s nice to live in this country .
it was not easy for us to find his house .
he is a lo@@ v@@ able person .
&quot; do you have a n@@ ic@@ k@@ name ? &quot; &quot; y@@ es , it &apos;s R@@ ic@@ k . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t speak my language .
don &apos;t inter@@ f@@ e@@ re in oth@@ ers &apos; af@@ fai@@ rs .
you can fo@@ ol all the people some of the time , and some of the people all the time , but you cannot fo@@ ol all the people all the time .
the pres@@ sure is bu@@ il@@ ding .
clo@@ se the fu@@ c@@ king door !
he is interes@@ ted in mus@@ ic .
reading books is my ho@@ b@@ by .
I like my st@@ ea@@ k r@@ are .
I never thought I &apos;d get that lu@@ ck@@ y .
Tom spea@@ ks French very f@@ lu@@ ent@@ ly .
un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , that has@@ n &apos;t been possible .
I thought he would come .
I want this one myself .
it &apos;ll co@@ st around thir@@ ty doll@@ ars .
he can &apos;t read it .
my sister &apos;s gu@@ it@@ ar is new .
Tom was lu@@ ck@@ y .
the little k@@ ids were very curi@@ ous .
C@@ ap@@ itu@@ late !
Tom told me that he &apos;d be late .
these sho@@ es are too big for me .
what &apos;s the other con@@ di@@ tion ?
you know nothing of the world .
what do you think about this plan ?
I will .
I ad@@ mit that at first I didn &apos;t like you .
we can &apos;t give up .
do you have a problem ?
the play@@ ers on this tea@@ m are all gi@@ ants .
this one is the wor@@ st .
I was on the bus .
Tom has a secret wea@@ po@@ n .
you won &apos;t be dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted .
it was so still that you would have heard a p@@ in dro@@ p .
I am so busy that I can &apos;t help you .
see you tomorrow !
he would be very gl@@ ad to hear the ne@@ ws .
Dan sp@@ ent the night having se@@ x with L@@ in@@ da .
don &apos;t use your re@@ al name .
this book is really small !
K@@ o@@ al@@ as are cu@@ te .
I &apos;m never happ@@ ier than when I &apos;m by myself .
must I leave at once ?
a book wor@@ th reading is wor@@ th reading t@@ wi@@ ce .
was any@@ body hur@@ t ?
it &apos;s dou@@ ble plea@@ sure to dec@@ ei@@ ve the dec@@ ei@@ ver .
all you have to do is talk .
he can speak R@@ us@@ si@@ an , too .
get the fu@@ ck out !
he en@@ jo@@ ys good heal@@ th .
all the sw@@ e@@ et talk was just a ru@@ se to get her into bed .
M@@ i@@ h@@ o pl@@ ays piano better than N@@ ori@@ k@@ o .
it me@@ ans that he likes you .
I knew it would happen so@@ on@@ er or l@@ ater .
Tom is re@@ al cu@@ te .
they made me go there .
I don &apos;t know how to sp@@ ell that word .
is this all y@@ ours ?
Dan tou@@ ted his r@@ ac@@ ist i@@ de@@ as to his friends .
I don &apos;t like cold wea@@ ther , but Tom does .
the cap@@ tain invit@@ ed her for brea@@ k@@ fast .
I live here alone .
did you gu@@ ys ho@@ ok up ?
there &apos;s really nothing more we can do .
I can &apos;t for@@ give him for be@@ having like that .
what would you do ?
Tom w@@ ouldn &apos;t let any@@ body help him .
Mary sin@@ gs best of all of the girls in cl@@ ass .
does anyone know what this is ?
you speak good French !

his car is g@@ ain@@ ing on us .

you &apos;re k@@ ill@@ ing me .
do you really want me to help you ?
but hu@@ man be@@ ings are differ@@ ent .
can &apos;t you en@@ h@@ ance the im@@ age ?
Tom p@@ us@@ hed back his ch@@ air and got up .
there are more important things in life .
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary &apos;s last name was .
I &apos;m sure I can find something for you to do .
to believe himself in the port of N@@ a@@ pl@@ es , all that was nee@@ ded was to see the g@@ list@@ en@@ ing of k@@ ni@@ ves .
all I want is money .
we c@@ li@@ m@@ bed right up to the to@@ p .
how long have you kno@@ wn M@@ is@@ s S@@ m@@ ith ?

nothing ever makes him ang@@ ry .
she said that she would fol@@ low him no matter where he went .
you don &apos;t have the right .
my bo@@ ss turned down his propos@@ al .
I &apos;ve lear@@ ned a lot about mo@@ der@@ n au@@ th@@ ors .
Tom married a much y@@ oun@@ ger woman .
Tom was w@@ ear@@ ing his p@@ a@@ j@@ am@@ as when he o@@ pened the door .
Tom cel@@ e@@ br@@ ated his for@@ ti@@ et@@ h bir@@ th@@ day the other day , without po@@ m@@ p or cer@@ em@@ on@@ y .

he is concer@@ ned about his father &apos;s ill@@ ness .
I &apos;m looking for@@ ward to see@@ ing him .

she ad@@ vis@@ ed him not to dri@@ ve too fast , but he w@@ ouldn &apos;t list@@ en to her .
money doesn &apos;t g@@ row on tre@@ es , you know .
I thought it difficult for her to get the ti@@ ck@@ et .
M@@ i@@ y@@ az@@ ak@@ i is not what it used to be .
J@@ oh@@ n &apos;s grand@@ mother pass@@ ed away after a long ill@@ ness .
sto@@ ri@@ es often have happy end@@ ings .
together , anything is possible .
Tom is a nat@@ ur@@ al ath@@ le@@ te .
they tried to dis@@ cour@@ age him from going .
there &apos;s no need to be ru@@ de .
Tom has to call his grand@@ mother .
what &apos;s the last thing you remember ?

keep up the good work .

I hi@@ d myself be@@ h@@ ind a cu@@ r@@ tain .

I want to dr@@ a@@ w your attention to@@ ward last qu@@ ar@@ ter &apos;s res@@ ul@@ ts which are very en@@ cour@@ ag@@ ing .
I should &apos;ve told you .
I &apos;ve got a good idea .
no sin@@ g@@ le s@@ pe@@ ec@@ h can er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate years of mis@@ tr@@ ust , no@@ r can I answ@@ er in the time that I have all the compl@@ e@@ x questions that br@@ ought us to this point .
we all have differ@@ ent str@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ s .
I like to co@@ ok all k@@ in@@ ds of food .
when he came , I was wri@@ ting a letter .
the ju@@ ry is still out .
what &apos;s your re@@ al pu@@ r@@ pose ?
he knows how to play the piano .
have you met anyone yet ?
try not to eat too much .
I nee@@ ded time to con@@ vin@@ ce her .
you &apos;ve turned up at the right moment .
I don &apos;t like cold coffee .
I have enough money to buy a car .
did you see what Tom did to Mary ?
Tom can play the gu@@ it@@ ar , I think .
this ho@@ tel was very n@@ ear the l@@ ake .
Tom went back into his office .
a car has one st@@ e@@ er@@ ing wh@@ e@@ el .

Tom read the contr@@ act in secret .

you &apos;re not f@@ at .
this is a good plan .
tell me why you were ab@@ sent from school yesterday .
everyone &apos;s there .
they &apos;ve chang@@ ed a lot .
talking to Tom isn &apos;t going to help .
you have the ad@@ v@@ ant@@ age of a good e@@ du@@ c@@ ation .
Tom does what he wants to .
no one fol@@ low@@ ed us .
what cri@@ ter@@ ion did you use when you el@@ ected this ess@@ ay as the win@@ ner ?
he was so chil@@ dis@@ h that he couldn &apos;t res@@ ist tem@@ p@@ t@@ ation .
it &apos;s a dou@@ ble @-@ e@@ d@@ g@@ ed s@@ word .
Sami should as@@ su@@ me respon@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty .
I was terri@@ b@@ ly fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed .
&quot; when will you come back ? &quot; &quot; it all de@@ p@@ ends on the wea@@ ther . &quot;

you &apos;re not to@@ t@@ ally bl@@ am@@ el@@ ess .
in g@@ am@@ es of chance , it &apos;s very important to know the probab@@ ili@@ ti@@ es of ev@@ ents .
does this b@@ ac@@ k@@ p@@ ack b@@ el@@ ong to him ?
are you sure that it was Tom ?
my grand@@ father no lon@@ ger has a dri@@ ver &apos;s lic@@ en@@ se .
I have here my brother &apos;s d@@ augh@@ ter with her k@@ ids .

th@@ en the do@@ ll &apos;s eyes beg@@ an to sh@@ ine like two star@@ s and it be@@ came ali@@ ve .
the det@@ ec@@ tive took down his t@@ es@@ ti@@ mon@@ y on the spo@@ t .
I think you &apos;re dr@@ un@@ k .
we are one , after all , you and I , together we suff@@ er , together ex@@ ist and fo@@ re@@ ver will rec@@ re@@ ate each other .
it &apos;s an ou@@ tr@@ age .
we all be@@ came sol@@ di@@ ers .
I hate these sho@@ es .
Tom is too young to go to school .
I don &apos;t like pay@@ ing ta@@ x@@ es .
Tom g@@ ets up at six every morning .

Tom and Mary are a mus@@ ic@@ al du@@ o .
I don &apos;t understand why people believe in g@@ ho@@ sts .
senten@@ ces can tea@@ ch us a lot . and a lot more than just wor@@ ds .
I succ@@ ee@@ ded in getting what I wanted .

there &apos;s no place like home .
Tom is eas@@ y@@ going , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s just a mi@@ su@@ n@@ der@@ st@@ and@@ ing .
I sup@@ pose you want to ask me where I &apos;ve been .
it was him that bro@@ ke the windo@@ w yesterday .
r@@ un as fast as you can and don &apos;t let go of my hand .
when were you thin@@ king of coming back to the S@@ t@@ ates ?
the po@@ or old man was re@@ du@@ ced to just a sk@@ el@@ et@@ on .
where &apos;s my phone ?
Tom couldn &apos;t do something like that .

I was tem@@ p@@ ted to call in sick .
the ni@@ gh@@ t@@ life is better in N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k .

Tom made Mary happy .
I would al@@ so take a lot of money .
it &apos;s the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate t@@ est .
J@@ u@@ g@@ gl@@ ing is ac@@ tu@@ ally a lot eas@@ ier than it looks .
Mary knows nothing of se@@ w@@ ing or k@@ n@@ it@@ ting .
my last name is J@@ on@@ es .
that &apos;s sor@@ t of nice .
he dri@@ ves a tru@@ ck .
everyone was s@@ cre@@ am@@ ing .

they kno@@ c@@ ked on the door and said they had come to ar@@ r@@ est him .
I wai@@ ted for an h@@ our , but he didn &apos;t app@@ ear .
I got up while it was still d@@ ar@@ k .
what does this pain@@ ting re@@ pres@@ ent ?
the p@@ sy@@ cho@@ log@@ ist asked me a wh@@ ole b@@ at@@ ter@@ y of questions .
she left the ho@@ sp@@ ital an h@@ our ag@@ o .
I wai@@ ted for him all day long .
this was his one and only hope .
I st@@ op@@ ped at the sto@@ re and got some mil@@ k on my way back .
be nice .
he is just mus@@ ic@@ ally gi@@ f@@ ted . he m@@ as@@ ter@@ ed the gu@@ it@@ ar in one year at the age of 1@@ 5 .

do you think something like that will re@@ pe@@ at it@@ self ?
gu@@ ess wh@@ ose bir@@ th@@ day it is today .
do you love me ?
some of these are mine .
there is a school down the m@@ oun@@ tain .
prom@@ ise me you won &apos;t do that again .

you need to s@@ ave the prin@@ c@@ ess .
who won today ?
ex@@ cu@@ se me . can you direc@@ t me to the ne@@ ar@@ est sub@@ way station ?
I list@@ en@@ ed to the ra@@ di@@ o while I wor@@ ked .

leave me alone .
I met B@@ o@@ b and Mary while I was waiting for K@@ ate .
Tom es@@ cap@@ ed .
can you do a hand@@ stand ?
who does your dec@@ or@@ ating ?

I was about to go out when the phone r@@ an@@ g .
after what has happened , I d@@ are not see her again .
you &apos;re very busy .
you are to see a doctor at once .
ad@@ d the m@@ ay@@ onn@@ ai@@ se .
Ger@@ many was once al@@ li@@ ed with I@@ tal@@ y .
do your parents know about this ?
I &apos;m sure that I &apos;ll miss her a lot .
I was too tired to care for anything but bed .
he won a go@@ ld me@@ d@@ al .
that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong with you .
bo@@ th Tom and Mary smo@@ ke .
it &apos;s ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ ant .
the man is e@@ ating bre@@ ad .
he is of a hu@@ mor@@ ous turn of mind .
A@@ aw@@ w ! he &apos;s so cu@@ te .
K@@ az@@ ak@@ h@@ st@@ an is one of the dev@@ el@@ op@@ ed coun@@ tri@@ es in C@@ entr@@ al A@@ si@@ a .
I can &apos;t th@@ ank you enough for all your k@@ in@@ d@@ ness .
he k@@ ep@@ t his sen@@ se of hu@@ mo@@ r until the day he died .
I need more pap@@ er for my dr@@ a@@ win@@ gs .
Tom has two le@@ gs .
I will be working on my re@@ port all day tomorrow .
I &apos;m trying to remember .
for the time being , I in@@ ten@@ d to stay at a ho@@ tel .
you should go and have your h@@ air cut .
as u@@ su@@ al , he was the last to arrive at the the@@ ater .
I know Tom is a good ac@@ tor .
could you please take care of my dog while I &apos;m in Boston ?
do you know how to play ma@@ h@@ j@@ ong ?
I am not a doctor , but a teacher .
I think it &apos;s very li@@ k@@ ely that they &apos;ll arrive next week .
as he couldn &apos;t end@@ ure , he took to his he@@ el@@ s .
the ju@@ ry didn &apos;t buy Dan &apos;s story .
is anyone el@@ se going ?
you don &apos;t even know how .
nobody can hear you there .
the door was already open .
I love the way Tom does that .
do you have any bro@@ th@@ ers or sist@@ ers ?
&quot; Mary , the coffee is too str@@ ong for me . &quot; &quot; O@@ h , I am sorry . per@@ hap@@ s ad@@ d a little mil@@ k . &quot;
he made a s@@ pe@@ ec@@ h in which he sup@@ por@@ ted my opinion .
I didn &apos;t know what I &apos;d find .
Tom has@@ n &apos;t re@@ ali@@ z@@ ed his mist@@ ake yet .
if you go to that su@@ per@@ mar@@ k@@ et , you can buy most things you use in your d@@ ai@@ ly life .
let &apos;s r@@ est a little .
there was ab@@ so@@ lu@@ tel@@ y nothing you could do about it .
do you like hor@@ ro@@ r mo@@ vi@@ es ?
wh@@ ose turn is it ?
do you have any ad@@ vice for me ?
J@@ an@@ e is not as t@@ all as Mary .
where does J@@ oh@@ n live ?
I loo@@ ked around and no@@ ti@@ ced that mine was the only car on the ro@@ ad .
I think that &apos;s the best answ@@ er .
what fo@@ o@@ ds , if any , do you avo@@ id e@@ ating ?
I &apos;m not as busy as Tom .
I don &apos;t know how to do it .
that arti@@ cle makes fun of ve@@ get@@ ar@@ i@@ ans .
did you take the money ?
Sami re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ z@@ ed the man in the photo .
we should just en@@ jo@@ y this and not wor@@ ry about how much it co@@ sts .
he &apos;s a hun@@ k .
I asked you first .
she &apos;s right be@@ h@@ ind you .

where did you hear that story ?

she p@@ us@@ hed him off the pi@@ er .
I don &apos;t exp@@ ect you to understand it .
give a th@@ i@@ e@@ f enough ro@@ pe and he &apos;ll h@@ an@@ g himself .
I still can &apos;t understand that .
Tom left his tru@@ m@@ p@@ et at school .
he arriv@@ ed at mi@@ d@@ night .
this looks good .
we went on a pic@@ ni@@ c together .

I didn &apos;t know why Tom didn &apos;t want us there .
let &apos;s drink to his succ@@ ess .

I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m tel@@ ling you this .

may we use the language la@@ b ?
you for@@ got to pr@@ acti@@ ce ?
everybody saw it .
that &apos;s enough now !
it &apos;s just fi@@ ve in the morning , but n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess it is light out .
I didn &apos;t mo@@ ve a thing .
my father was a doctor .
in many w@@ ays , these fo@@ s@@ s@@ il@@ s are the &apos; smo@@ king g@@ un &apos; just before the em@@ er@@ g@@ ence of our own gen@@ us .
there &apos;s no ur@@ gen@@ c@@ y .

children g@@ row very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
are you on your way home ?
how can it be that ma@@ th@@ em@@ ati@@ c@@ s , being after all a produ@@ c@@ t of hu@@ man thought in@@ de@@ pend@@ ent of ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence , is so ad@@ mi@@ r@@ ab@@ ly ad@@ ap@@ ted to the obj@@ ec@@ ts of re@@ al@@ ity ?

her sk@@ in was al@@ most trans@@ lu@@ cent .
how could I for@@ get ?
let me buy you a new one .
Tom is s@@ mar@@ t .
let us sing a s@@ ong .
I had a cou@@ ple of questions , but I didn &apos;t ask them .
F@@ em@@ in@@ ine lo@@ gi@@ c is not always log@@ ic@@ al .
when we started out , our b@@ and could only find small c@@ lu@@ b@@ s in small ci@@ ti@@ es that would hi@@ re us .
you should resp@@ ect the ru@@ les your parents set for you .
don &apos;t tell Tom about what we plan to do next wee@@ k@@ end .
I told you I have a gir@@ l@@ friend .
I need you right now .
Sami saw L@@ ay@@ la hur@@ r@@ ying .
leave our house .
I &apos;ll l@@ end it to you .
I may need to mo@@ ve on .
I believe that he &apos;s happy .
qu@@ it talking , will you ?
they set out for N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k .
I des@@ pi@@ se them .
my cat sle@@ pt next to me .

the f@@ lo@@ or is co@@ ver@@ ed with a th@@ ic@@ k car@@ p@@ et .
Tom has a small f@@ ar@@ m not far from Boston .

can you dri@@ ve a sti@@ ck shi@@ ft ?
I go to the the@@ at@@ re .
Dan par@@ ked the r@@ ent@@ al car n@@ ear the police station .
where do you want to go for our first l@@ es@@ son ?
man is the dog &apos;s best friend .
Tom won@@ der@@ ed why Mary had st@@ ay@@ ed in Boston .
I won@@ der if there &apos;s some way of at@@ tr@@ ac@@ ting more Jap@@ an@@ ese spea@@ k@@ ers to Tatoeba ?
there were no b@@ oun@@ ds to his am@@ bi@@ tion .
P@@ in@@ ea@@ p@@ ple is rich in c@@ it@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id .
we are going to the country .
I know what it &apos;s like to be hear@@ t@@ bro@@ ken .
how did it come about ?
wh@@ ose turn is it to make dinner ton@@ ight ?
I thought you &apos;d want to see this mo@@ vie .
did I do all that ?
we &apos;re lu@@ ck@@ y to be ali@@ ve .
you can dri@@ ve a car , can &apos;t you ?
as so@@ on as we got to the l@@ ake , we started sw@@ im@@ ming .
yesterday , he told me the truth .
gi@@ ving up smo@@ king is the eas@@ i@@ est thing in the world . I know because I &apos;ve done it th@@ ous@@ and@@ s of times .
the dog is thir@@ st@@ y .
I heard that a g@@ ay pri@@ est had been prom@@ o@@ ted to the r@@ ank of b@@ is@@ ho@@ p , but it turned out to be a f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ ation .
the food isn &apos;t very good here .
what do you me@@ an , &quot; I don &apos;t like it &quot; ?
he had long h@@ air last year .
your question has no answ@@ er .
how aw@@ ful !
I hate it when my parents fi@@ ght .
he who does not work does not have the right to eat .
don &apos;t be a str@@ anger .
I know Tom is all right now .
Tom said he would try .
we need to correc@@ t those mist@@ a@@ ken as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions .
I would think you have other things to keep you busy .
Sami was fi@@ ve minutes away .
Tom is coming to our school tomorrow .
she lo@@ ved her mother de@@ ar@@ ly .
I plea@@ ded not gu@@ il@@ ty .
we can &apos;t pos@@ t@@ po@@ ne the meeting .
you aren &apos;t invit@@ ed .
long live the g@@ er@@ i@@ o@@ cr@@ ac@@ y !
she cannot play the piano .
m@@ en only think about one thing .
he didn &apos;t do that out of me@@ an@@ ness , but ra@@ ther out of ab@@ sent @-@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness .
y@@ es , I am married .
never talk to str@@ ang@@ ers .
how could you do that ?
I had to go back .
I have a pre@@ di@@ l@@ ec@@ tion for be@@ e@@ f .
you have everything .
Tom told me Mary was busy .
I want to see it .
they must be cr@@ azy to believe such n@@ on@@ sen@@ se .
I want you to be qui@@ et .
C@@ o@@ tt@@ on ab@@ sor@@ b@@ s water .
get back to where you started .
I had to work on S@@ un@@ day .
you gu@@ ys su@@ ck .
who &apos;s going to co@@ ok for us ?
what language were they spea@@ king ?
never tell li@@ es .
bo@@ th al@@ tern@@ ati@@ ves are possible .
m@@ ay@@ be I should al@@ so ad@@ d senten@@ ces without trans@@ l@@ ations ? it is a very fast way of im@@ pro@@ ving the popul@@ ar@@ ity of one &apos;s own language .
do you want to b@@ et on that ?
we made s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ic@@ es .
I had only one drink .
I &apos;ve cho@@ s@@ en her to be my wife .
I can &apos;t k@@ is@@ s you the way you want to be k@@ is@@ sed .
stop t@@ wi@@ st@@ ing my ar@@ m !
if he s@@ ends me any let@@ ters , I just t@@ ear them up and th@@ row them away .

I &apos;m trying to c@@ le@@ an the house .

the questions came fast and fu@@ ri@@ ous from the lar@@ ge num@@ ber of re@@ por@@ ters who had g@@ ath@@ er@@ ed out@@ side the cour@@ th@@ ou@@ se .
I remember those days .

Sami didn &apos;t really like that girl .
I can &apos;t get the c@@ a@@ p off this bo@@ ttle .
I re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ z@@ ed her at first gl@@ ance .
I want to talk to you alone .
we &apos;d better leave her alone .
A@@ l@@ th@@ ough Mary is sick , she will work .
happy is the man who is con@@ ten@@ ted .
I was bo@@ red .
if I were heal@@ th@@ y , I would be happy .
she has left us .
she asked him for some money .
I &apos;m not really that thir@@ st@@ y .
have fun with that .
there is something tr@@ op@@ ic@@ al and ex@@ o@@ ti@@ c about her which form@@ s a sin@@ gu@@ l@@ ar contr@@ ast to her co@@ ol and un@@ em@@ o@@ ti@@ on@@ al brother .

there &apos;s a du@@ ck on her shi@@ r@@ t .
it &apos;s easy to have a cl@@ ear con@@ sci@@ ence when it &apos;s not used .
are you ve@@ get@@ ar@@ i@@ an ?
if you want something to be done right , some@@ times you &apos;ve just got to do it yourself .
the wor@@ k@@ ers are ag@@ ain@@ st the new plan .
they st@@ ay@@ ed in the room with me for the wh@@ ole night .

P@@ r@@ ay for all of us .
my brother de@@ p@@ ends on me for money .

A@@ chi@@ ev@@ ing a nice w@@ el@@ d b@@ ead is not with@@ in everyone &apos;s re@@ ac@@ h !
someone sp@@ i@@ ked her drink .

Tom put too much su@@ g@@ ar in my coffee .
th@@ ous@@ and@@ s of people wanted to know the answ@@ er .
